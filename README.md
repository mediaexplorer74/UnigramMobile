# UnigramMobile - main branch
![](Images/logo.png)

This is my own uncomplete UnigramMobile "remake" (or RnD) for Windows 10 Mobile os. 
It's my "retro-dev" in 2022 year. I decided to share it "as is" :)

## Words of the author about original Unigram Mobile Messenger

"The Telegram client optimised for the Windows 10 Mobile platform.

Thanks to the [Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp), Unigram can run on any Windows 10 device (PC, smartphones, Xbox One, Holo Lens and Surface Hub), integrated with almost all the new Windows features, it provides a seamless and consistent user experience. Unigram Mobile continues to support Windows 10 Mobile smartphones, whereas the original Unigram stopped the support at the end of 2019."
